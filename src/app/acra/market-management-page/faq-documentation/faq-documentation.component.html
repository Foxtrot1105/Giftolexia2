        I have opted for Auto Top-Up but why am I having zero API balance calls ?
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <div class="text-faq">
          <p>In case where user opted for Auto Top-Up but there were API calls which were left un-utilised after
            validity period, hence expired, the Auto Top-Up function will be disabled by system to avoid further payment
            by user.</p>
          <p>If user's balance API calls were only partially expired (i.e. user has API calls with varying expiry dates
            within the same API category), Auto Top-Up function will not be disabled.</p>
          <p>It is posisble for user to re-purchase API package with Auto Top-Up after previous purchase has expired.
